# Classical Algorithms and Data Structure in Rust
## Motivation
In order to study the Rust programming language and its nuances, I decided to implement all classical algorithms and data structures that we learn in computer science.

With this in mind, I have four main references that is constantly used in every part of this project:
1. [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
2. [Rust by example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/)
3. [Command line apps in Rust](https://rust-cli.github.io/book/)
4. [PUC Minas university practical exercises](https://github.com/icei-pucminas/aeds2/tree/master/tps/enunciado)

## What to expect
Implementations that explore Rust nuances such as ownership, error handling, tests, functional programming paradigm, etc.

Algorithms implementations using multiple data structures and sync/async versions. For example, search in vectors and search in trees (binary search).

## How this project works
You will find multiple ways to run this project as more algorithms will be added and the project evolves. Below you can find how to run this project with the latest commit.

`cargo run -- [algorithm_name] < [file_for_stdin]`

## KISS
This documentation will be kept as simple as possible, I will keep updating it as the project matures.

## Suggestions
Feel free to help me with my studies. Open an issue for a new algorithm, data_structure or this documentation itself.
